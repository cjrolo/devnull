# devnull

This as the name says, it is like /dev/null. Every time I write some piece of code that could be relevant and doesn't fit anywhere else (like its own project or is more than a gist) it will just fall here.
I will try this as only Cassandra/cassandra automation relevant tasks.


For the python code do:
pip install cassandra-driver

Scripts
=======

This folder contains automation scripts. Like someone once told me: "If you do something twice that you could automate, I'll smack you!"
